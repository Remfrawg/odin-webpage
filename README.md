# odin-webpage
CSS project for TOP foundations
This will be a webpage created using flexboxes, buttons, and text
The point of this project is to practice CSS and HTML before moving on to Javascript
There is an intended outcome in the folder as well

TO LEARN:
    -When to use flex vs block vs inline vs ib
    -make s1 more adjustable (title, first image, etc.)
    -best practice container/class names
    --- how to align text and a button vertically when next to eachother
        -see the sign up button
    - cool buttons
Learned:
    -Pad containers to move everything instead of margins on contents
    -Some things like ul/h1 have built in margins that you have to override to get things lined up.
    -Flex things you want to grow and shrink, block or inline things you want to keep a certain size or set min/max params so they dont go wild. 
    -flex -> space-between or center will usually do the trick
    -image manipulation is finicky 
    -i like buttons
